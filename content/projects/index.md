### fx-CG50 Manager PLUS - gdbserver

A GDB Remote Serial Protocol implementation that hooks to
[fx-CG50 Manager PLUS](https://edu.casio.com/products/classroom/fxcgm_plus/)
allowing to debug code running on the emulated calculator.

It can be used to debug add-ins as well as to help reverse-engineer CASIOWIN.
Be aware that the emulator is far from being 100% accurate and the firmware is
different from the one found on real hardware.
