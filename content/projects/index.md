### INEPLEM

A complete toolkit i made to exploit [*iTalc*](https://github.com/iTALC/italc/)
from the student side.

I will probably make a second version under the name *VNEPLEM* to make something
more modern and versatile with the support of [*Veyon*](https://veyon.io/)
instead of *iTalc*.

### wifi_icon

Just a simple python script I used in my old dotfiles to show the strenght of
the wifi signal using a Gtk `StatusIcon`.

# Old bad and ugly projects, STOP SCROLLING
### Streamcleaner

An old, probably broken, bookmarklet that allowed to get the direct link to
videos on some video hosting platforms. If you want something usable and more
reliable, use [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html).

### [FR] WACH

Un (tr√®s vieux) projet... Un simple bookmarklet qui permettait de tricher sur
le site *WebAllemand*.
