Hello !

I've just made my website a little more usefull and modern. The old one was just
a fancy list of my GitHub repos in French. This time I will try to post usefull
stuffs...

I use the *[Hugo](https://gohugo.io)* static website generator and of course
everything is avaliable publicly on [GitHub](https://github.com/redoste/redoste.xyz).
